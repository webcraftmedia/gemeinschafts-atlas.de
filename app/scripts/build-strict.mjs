/**
 * Runs the production build and treats every warning as a failure.
 *
 * Why this exists: `nuxt build` is the only step that exercises Nitro's scan of
 * server/, the auto-import registry and the Vue compiler on every page at once.
 * Whole classes of breakage are invisible to lint, typecheck and the unit suite
 * and only show up here — a spec file picked up as a Nitro plugin, two modules
 * exporting the same auto-import, a component that only fails to compile in the
 * production pipeline.
 *
 * Nuxt reports those as warnings and still exits 0, so the build alone is not a
 * gate. This wrapper makes it one: any consola WARN or ERROR line fails the run.
 *
 * Usage (from app/):  npm run test:build
