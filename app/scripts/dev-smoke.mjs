/**
 * Starts the dev server, fetches a page, and fails on any warning.
 *
 * Why this exists in addition to the production build: the two pipelines are not
 * the same, and dev is the stricter of the two. A spec file that Nitro picks up
 * as a server plugin aborts `nuxt dev` with a Rollup error, while `nuxt build`
 * quietly tree-shakes it away and produces a working artefact — so the build is
 * green while nobody can start the app. That is exactly the shape of breakage
 * that has to be caught before a merge, not after a checkout.
 *
 * Readiness is decided by asking the port, never by reading the output: Nuxt
 * colours the URL it prints, and in CI the port carries its own escape sequence
 * ("localhost:\x1b[1m3099\x1b[22m"), so matching on the text is a trap. The log
 * is still scanned for warnings — see lib/log-levels.mjs for why that needs care.
 *
 * Usage (from app/):  npm run test:smoke
